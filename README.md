### Junior Full Stack Developer

I am a Junior Full Stack Developer, with 5 years' experience as a technical
Product Manager in a digital health startup, and a passion for the combination
of efficient technological solutions and compelling user experiences.

Combining a background in experimental psychology, with my startup training,
I favour a thorough and analytical, yet creative approach to problems.

I am looking to work with smart, determined people, in an environment that rewards
curiosity and courage, and ultimately aims to make the world a better place.

### Skills

#### Analytical and structured thinking
In my previous role at Big Health I proved myself to be a fastidious and critical
thinker. As such, I was trusted with projects that involved the most complex user
and business needs, for example a user authentication system compliant with UK
and US healthcare laws. In development this allows me to rapidly step through
potential approaches, identifying edge cases and anticipating problems.

#### Flexibility and speed
I am very comfortable with uncertainty, seek out novelty, and feel confident in my
ability to rapidly upskill whenever a challenge requires it. For example, I
recently chose to work on a project that required me to teach myself Swift in
2 weeks to build a realtime, multiplayer drawing game prototype called "[Drawsome](https://github.com/rgollancz/drawApp)"!

#### Design and creativity
Whether it's in the context of page layouts, domain models, or planning meetings,
I appreciate and seek out good design. Working in Product, I made it my business
to understand UX best-practices. In development I understand the impact of code
design and visual design on efficiency, and usability and accessibility.
