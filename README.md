### Junior Full Stack Developer

I am a experienced technical Product Manager, turned Junior Full Stack Developer,
with a passion for the combination of x and compelling user experiences.

After 5 years’ as a PM in a successful digital health startup, I am seeking my
first development role.

Combining a background in experimental psychology, with my fast-paced startup
training, I favour a thorough and analytical, yet creative approach to problems.

I am looking to work with smart, determined people, in an environment that rewards
curiosity and courage, and ultimately aims to make the world a better place.

### Skills

#### Analytical and structured thinking
In my previous role at Big Health I proved myself to be a fastidious and critical
thinker. As such, I was trusted with projects that involved converting high-level user
and business needs into often complex and sensitive specifications, for example a
user authentication system. In development this allows me to rapidly step through
potential approaches, identifying edge cases and anticipating problems.

### Curiosity and speed of learning
I am very comfortable with novelty and uncertainty, and feel confident in my
ability to rapidly upskill whenever a challenge requires it. For example, I
recently chose to work on a project that required me to teach myself enough Swift
in 2 weeks to produce a realtime, multiplayer drawing game prototype called
"Drawsome"!
